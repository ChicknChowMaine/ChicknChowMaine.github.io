    <h2>Before|The|Examination</h2>
    

    <h3>Studying regularly</h3>
        
        <p>
            I can not stress this enough but studying, even just an hour a day, will help <b>A LOT</b>.  By following this tip, you essentially allow yourself to learn the whole syllabus faster. This will enable you to move onto sitting past papers, which will better prepare you for the actual examinations as you will become more accustomed to the IGCSE style, the sort of questions they will ask, etc. I would aslo like to note that some teachers, myself included, would urge students to start working through past papers as early on as possible - i.e. late term 1 (or even earlier!).This may sound very illogical to you, and I would have to agree with you, but as I said before, you want to start these papers as soon as possible. At first, you only need to do the questions that you can do, and that may only be 1/10 or less of the entire paper, which is completely fine. As you progress through the year, you will find that you are able to answer more and more questions. Remember, these papers are not going anywhere, you can always go back and redo the paper. That being said, it would not be wise to partially complete all of the practice papers (more elaborated in 'Practice Papers'), but this shoudln't present an issue if you study everyday.
        </p> 
        
        <h3>Tuition</h3>
        
        <p>
            This is a big one, and possibly the greatest piece of advice I could give you, get a tutor! While you could get tuition outside of school, and may already do, Christchurch Boys' High readily provides boys with tuition opportunities (not to mention at a good price). At the time of writing, the school is working on a tuition program in which senior students can volunteer to tutor juniors students in subjects such as math, science and English. For now and the purpose of this website, you should just concern yourself with the mathematics aspect. This is the first time the school has trialed something such as this and as a result, I am not exactly sure how this program is going to work. I have volunteered to partake in this program as a tutor and still do not have an idea. However, as there was no mention of us tutors being paid, it would seem as though these lessons are going to be cost free. Good for you guys, not so much for us tutors. That aside, the year prior (2020), I received tution for my examination through a program that was organised with the math H.O.D (Head of Department). Whether or not this program is going to be around in the future or  is going to be incorporated into this larger, school organised tuition program, I have not the slightest clue. Nonetheless, I guarantee that you will be in safe hands and most likely given a tutor who has achieved an exceptional grade in the IGCSE examinations. Having been through this myself, I can say with confidence that it was a wise choice to get tutored and I found it extremely enjoyble and beneficial. There are so many benefits to these student to student tutoring programs, including and not limited to getting to know a senior (who can pass down their own experiences and tips), you get to learn with and from people your around own age, you are able to learn in a very friendly, relaxing and safe environment and many more. Best of all, you can get access to all of these benefits at a relatively good price or maybe even free!
          
        <br>
        <br>
            
        "What!? Free!?"
        
        <br>
        <br>
            
        Yes, I said Free! So what are you waiting for! Sign up today (or as soon as possible)!
        </p>
        
    <h3>Memorising Formulae</h3>
        
        <p>For this examination, memorising your formulae is absolutely crucial (unfortunately, they will not be spoon-fed to you), and due to the many different formulae, this is made extremely difficult. So how could you go about this you may ask? My best piece of advice to you is to write out the entire formula in your working out of every question. This is tedious, but it is a sure fire way to cement these formulae into your memory. Additionally, you should come up with  your own unique way of memorising these formulae, as it will help you memorise them much more quickly . For example, the trigonometric formula for the area of a triangle can be memorised as "half ab sink" (1/2absin c). If you are the type of person that can memorise formulae without the need for this sort of thing, then by all means, do your thing; however, to the rest of you, this method may prove to be very useful. The most important thing to take away here is that all that matters is whether or not you can remember your formulae, the way you go about that matters not.</p>
    
        <h3>Practice Papers</h3>
        
        For starters, you want to be printing off physical  copies of papers, as it is better  practice, and in general, than working on them online. If you don't have a printer, like me, you can always email Stationary Warehouse (and similar places) to print them out for you. Just save the desired past paper to your computer and attach it to  the email (don't forget to state how you want them to print out your papers - i.e. single sided and stapeled together - and most importantly, DON'T FORGET YOUR MANNERS). This is a great alternative if you do not have a printer and the staff are very nice and friendly. 
        <p>(When workig through past papers) Resist the temptation to check the answers after every question. This will force you to rethink over your calculations more critically and help you spot potential errors in your working out. This is a critical skill to have, as you will not be provided the answers in the real thing (duh!)  and may save you from making silly mistakes, subsequently causing you to get a completely different answer.

        As you near the end of the year, and examination day, you want to be as prepared as possible.  By mid term 3, your class should have covered the entire syllabus; however, ideally you want to have covered it well before this. In doing so, you can begin to fully complete pass papers. To train yourself to perform optimally during your examination means to simulate the actual examination itself. To elaborate on this, you want to set yourself up in a quite environment, free of distractions, and in a time frame in your agenda where you will be undistrupted for the entire paper. Sit yourself down at a desk with the paper in front of you and set a timer for the stated duration of the paper. Then begin your test and as previously mentioned, do not look at the answers until you have finished the test. You will be able to get a good idea on how much you can get done  in that certain amount of time, the accuracy of your answers  and areas/topics that you struggle with.

    <h2>On|The|Day|of|The|Examination</h2>
        
        <h3>Preparations</h3>
        
        <p>Assuming your examinations are anything like mine were, they will most likely take place in the morning and end around break. You want to make sure that you have prepared your equipment before hand (i.e. the night prior), double checking in the morning  and triple checking before you leave the house. You have to be certain that you have everything you need, making sure to bring a few extra pens (in case the first and second one don't work)  and if you are feeling extra paranoid, why not buy buy a brand new calculator? Taking these extreme percausions may cause your fellow peers to laugh at you; however, you will be the one laughing when their calculator dies or their pens run out of ink. It's okay to be cautious! 
            
        <br>
        <br>
           
         Have some breakfast and something to drink. Thinking on an empty stomach is next to impossible, so make sure to eat something! I suggest something light, but enough to not feel hungry for the duration of the examination. Have a drink of water while you are at it as well, but you can bring a clear drink bottle along with you into the examination room. Although, hopefully, you will be too busy speeding through the  exam that you forget that you are thirsty in the first place. While we are on this topic, I thought I would also address this, go to the toilet before the examination! I would also advise you to take a poop the night before, refrain from eating anything that may cause stomach upset and urinate the morning of the examination. I know, I know. This is all common sense but I deemed it worth the mention nonetheless. 
       
            
        <br>

        Additionally, you want to wake up early. How early you get up is entirely up to you, but do not wake up too early that you don't get enough sleep and make sure you rest up well. During this  time, do some last minute revision on formulae and/or certain topics and areas, as it will enable you to have these ideas fresh in your mind for the examination. It will also serve to warm up your brain before you force it to do some major number crunching later on. You should also aim to arrive at school early, well before the time that you must be at said location. Before the examination starts, you can check with your fellow friends and classmates on things you are still unsure about and you ensure that you will not miss or be late for the test. Remember, "if you are on time, you are late".
        
        </p>
        
        <h3>Time Management</h3>
        
        <p>
        
        Do not spend too long on one question. If you struggle to understand what the question is asking for, move on. Remember, you can always go back. Dwaddling too long can  be fatal and you can lose out on other marks and more importantly  lose time. If things go smoothly, you may have around 20 minutes to check back on previous answers or attempt questions that you skipped. These examinations are essentially a race against time, so spend your time wisely.
        
            <p>
        
        <h3>Nerves</h3>
        
        <p>Understandably, you will probably feel very nervous and anxious as you wait outside the examination doors, but dont feel as though you're alone, many of your peers probably feel the same way. I was nervous too. This is probably because you recognise that this is a very important exam, one in which that can help you later in life - i.e. you can use your IGCSE results to apply for universities, etc. As this is an international standard, it may  increase your chances of getting accepted into universities overseas.  So, yeah, its a pretty big deal. As you begin your examination, you nerves will probably get the better of you. While its good that you understand the importance of this examination, it will not help you during your exam in the slightest. Like mine did, your hands might tremble uncontrollably and it may not do what you want it to do. But do not fret, the key is to breathe. Take some deep breaths and as you progress further into the paper, your trembles and nervousness will begin to fade as you enter, what I like to call, the zone. But why do you need to read this anyways, you don't have to worry because you  have been doing pass papers everyday... right? You have been doing them right!? Jokes aside, you are going to do well, don't stress it. For those that are completely unfazed by all of this... are you even human???
