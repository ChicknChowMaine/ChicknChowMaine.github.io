    "Who am I?" you may ask and to that I would answer "no one". I am but a simple man.. and a cultured one too. In my free time I like to watch "Japanese cartoons", formally known as anime. Why do I watch these for hours upon hours a day? Because reality is toxic. Anime is my escape. Anyways, I did in fact used to have a life; however, most of that information is not up for public disclousre. Unfortuantely for me, a school assignment requires me to tell you a bit about myself. I'm quite the boring person, so I'll tell you a little bit about my old self. Before I do, you can visit <a href="http://animkisa.tv/"> here </a>   to escape your toxic reality too.
