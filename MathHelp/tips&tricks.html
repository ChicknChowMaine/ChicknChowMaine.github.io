    <h2>Before The Examination</h2>
    

    <h3>Studying regularly</h3>
        
        <p>I can not stress this enough but studying, even just an hour a day, will help <b>A LOT</b>.  By following this tip, you essentially allow yourself to learn the whole syllabus faster. This will enable you to move onto sitting past papers, which will better prepare you for the actual examinations as you will become more accustomed to the IGCSE style, the sort of questions they will ask, etc.</p> 
        <h3>Tuition</h3>
        
        <p>This is a big one, and possibly the greatest piece of advice I could give you, get a tutor! While you could get tuition outside of school, and may already do, Christchurch Boys' High readily provides boys with tuition opportunities (not to mention at a good price). At the time of writing, the school is working on a tuition program in which senior students can volunteer to tutor juniors students in subjects such as math, science and English. For now and the purpose of this website, you should just concern yourself with the mathematics aspect. This is the first time the school has trialed something such as this and as a result, I am not exactly sure how this program is going to work. I have volunteered to partake in this program as a tutor and still do not have an idea. However, as there was no mention of us tutors being paid, it would seem as though these lessons are going to be cost free. Good for you guys, not so much for us tutors. That aside, the year prior (2020), I received tution for my examination through a program that was organised with the math H.O.D (Head of Department). Whether or not this program is going to be around in the future or  is going to be incorporated into this larger, school organised tuition program, I have not the slightest clue. Nonetheless, I guarantee 
            
        Having been through this experience, I can say with confidence that it was a wise choice to get tutored. I found it extremely enjoyble and beneficial.  </p>
